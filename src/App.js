                  <p className="description">Co-founder, chief platform officer, board member (volunteer). I crafted the organization’s brand meeting strategic goals, and produced all of the collateral (business cards, pamplhets, presentation materials, ads). I conceived, designed and implemented an open source tool Poly to advance the organziation’s mission, presented it by invitation at the New York Tech Meetup’s respected Hack of the Month segment and raised a record breaking kickstarter campaign to build it and the distributed team of open source contributors that helps me maintain it.</p>

                  <p className="description">Product manager, front-end developer, ui/ux designer. I branded, led product design and strategy, and managed the implementation of Amicus Post, a tool that replaced the core business and was featured at NY Tech Meetup. Amicus Post is a widely used direct action tool for political advocacy and outreach, trusted by Airbnb, the Human Rights Campaign, Greenpeace, Everytown for Gun Safety and many more. Amicus has since rebranded the business to use the visual vocabulary I developed for Amicus Post.</p>
