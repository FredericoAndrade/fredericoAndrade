                <p>EndDash is a two-way-binding javascript templating framework built on top of semantic HTML. It was developed by the engineers at Amicus during the time I was at the company.</p>
              </section>
              <section className="two-col">
                <p>Once it reached a mature enough stage to be opened to the general public, the framework required a public documentation page. We built in a range of small interactions that showcase the strenghts of the framework throughout the docs, with bi-directional binding weaving the visitor's name througout the page.</p>
                <p>The aesthetic of the page was also derived from Amicus' own brand â€“ the same color palette reinforces the relationship to the parent company.</p>
